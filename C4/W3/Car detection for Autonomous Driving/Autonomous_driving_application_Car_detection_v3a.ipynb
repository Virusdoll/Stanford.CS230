In other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x increases, we move to the right.  As y increases, we move down.\r\n",
    "- For this exercise, we define a box using its two corners: upper left $(x_1, y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and width. (This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection).\r\n",
    "- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its width $(x_2 - x_1)$. (Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.\r\n",
    "- To find the **intersection** of the two boxes $(xi_{1}, yi_{1}, xi_{2}, yi_{2})$: \r\n",
    "    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.\r\n",
    "    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate that is closer to the bottom.\r\n",
    "    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is closer to the top.\r\n",
    "    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least one of these lengths is negative, then there is no intersection (intersection area is zero).  \r\n",
